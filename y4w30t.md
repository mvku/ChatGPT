> This code calculates the RDF for a set of `particles`, with positions given as an `N x 3` numpy array. The simulation box has length `box_length` and the RDF is calculated up to a maximum distance of `r_max`, using `bin_count` bins. The result is a histogram that represents the RDF. In this example, the RDF is plotted using matplotlib.

The Lorentzian curve is defined by the function `lorentzian`, which takes as input `x`, `amplitude`, `x0`, and `gamma` and returns the value of the Lorentzian curve at each `x` value. The `fit_lorentzian` function uses `curve_fit` to fit the Lorentzian curve to the data and returns the optimized parameters `amplitude`, `x0`, and `gamma`. In this example, a noisy Lorentzian curve is generated and then fitted, and the fitted curve is plotted along with the original data.

> This code uses the OpenCV library to track a single particle in a series of 2D images (frames). The `track_particle` function takes as input a list of frames and the initial location of the particle in the first frame. The function uses a sliding window approach to track the particle. In each iteration, it extracts a small window around the estimated location of the particle in the previous frame, and finds the maximum intensity within the window to determine the particle's location in the current frame. The function returns a list of particle locations in all the frames.

> 
> The implementation first converts the input image to grayscale and applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to get the edges in the image. Then, it uses the `cv2.findContours` function to find all the contours in the edge map. The function filters out the contours with the length of 3, which are most likely the contours of a triangle. If there are multiple contours with the length of 3, the function returns the first one. Finally, the function returns the vertices of the triangle as a list of (x, y) pairs, representing the three corners of the triangle.
